<p>If [CFG:client_discovery_header] is configured to be a non-empty string, then the
value is used as key in the <code>$_SERVER</code> superglobal array to determine
which header to use to find the IP address or hostname to use for 'connecting
back to'. This setting is only used in combination with
[CFG:discover_client_host] and is otherwise ignored.</p>

<p>For example, if [CFG:client_discovery_header] is set to
<code>HTTP_FORWARD_HOST</code>, then Xdebug will check
<code>$_SERVER['HTTP_FORWARD_HOST']</code> before the
<code>$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']</code> and
<code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']</code> variables.</p>

<p class="warning">PHP automatically prepends <code>HTTP_</code>, and converts
<code>-</code> to <code>_</code>, for received HTTP header names. The
<code>THIS-IS-MY-HOST</code> HTTP header is converted into
<code>$_SERVER['HTTP_THIS_IS_MY_HOST']</code>. Therefore, the
[CFG:client_discovery_header] needs to be set to
<code>HTTP_THIS_IS_MY_HOST</code> to match this.</p>
